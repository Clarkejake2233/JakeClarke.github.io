<h2>Cybersecurity Risk and Governance Intern - BECU</h2>
<h3>June 2021 - September 2021</h3>

Boeing Employees Credit Union (BECU) is one of the largest credit unions in the United States and I worked the Summer of 2021 as a Cybersecurity Risk and Governance Intern. The main project that I worked on was developing a new version of the credit unions Information System Risk Assessment (ISRA). Accompanying this, I also worked in a team to write the iser guide to train employees on how to report cybersecurity risk to our IRSA through a questionnaire. The process involved working with another intern to interview teams on how each of their systems or applications report cybersecurity risk. This information would then be used to generate an overall risk score for an annual report and the questionnaire was set up to accomidate the different report methods. I worked in a team of three to then write the user guide that would help employees fill out and answer questions reguarding cybersecuirty risk within their internal systems. After the User Guide was completed, it was used to train employees on how to correctly fill out the questionnaire. I also developed a trend report on the last four financial quarters of phishing tests. The report showed a 30% increase to our success rate over four financial quarters, and the information was used in a presentation.
